## ðŸ†• Engine Consolidation (Sprint 1) âœ… COMPLETED

### What changed?
* **Deleted legacy files**: `dynamic_chain_builder.py`, `workflow_engine.py` (simple_runner.py was already removed)
* Replaced **WorkflowRunner**, **DynamicChainBuilder** and the singleton `workflow_engine` with a single, cohesive engine layer.
* Introduced `app/core/engine_v2.py` containing:
  * `BaseWorkflowEngine` â€“ abstract contract with `validate()`, `build()`, and `execute()` methods
  * `LangGraphWorkflowEngine` â€“ production implementation backed by `GraphBuilder` + **LangGraph** with `MemorySaver` checkpointer
  * `StubWorkflowEngine` â€“ lightweight fallback used when `AF_USE_STUB_ENGINE=1`
* `WorkflowRunner` is now a thin compatibility shim delegating to the unified engine, so existing API/tests keep working.
* `GraphBuilder` enhanced for conditional routing & automatic node discovery (leverages `node_registry`).
* **All API endpoints migrated**: `workflows.py` and `workflow_tasks.py` now use the unified engine directly.

### How to migrate custom code
1. **Stop instantiating `WorkflowRunner` directly**.  Import the engine factory instead:
   ```python
   from app.core.engine_v2 import get_engine

   engine = get_engine()
   engine.build(flow_json)
   result = await engine.execute({"input": "Hello"})
   ```
2. Remove imports of `DynamicChainBuilder` or `workflow_engine`.
3. If you extended runner logic, port hooks to a **WorkflowService** in the service layer that wraps `get_engine()`.

### Feature flags
* Set `AF_USE_STUB_ENGINE=true` in `.env` to disable LangGraph for fast offline testing.

### Implementation Details
The unified engine provides three core methods:

1. **validate(flow_data)**: Static analysis of workflow structure
   ```python
   engine = get_engine()
   validation = engine.validate(flow_data)
   # Returns: {"valid": bool, "errors": list[str], "warnings": list[str]}
   ```

2. **build(flow_data, user_context)**: Compile workflow to executable LangGraph
   ```python
   engine.build(flow_data, user_context={"user_id": "123", "workflow_id": "abc"})
   ```

3. **execute(inputs, stream, user_context)**: Run the compiled workflow
   ```python
   # Synchronous execution
   result = await engine.execute({"input": "Hello"})
   
   # Streaming execution
   stream = await engine.execute({"input": "Hello"}, stream=True)
   async for event in stream:
       print(event)
   ```

### Migration Examples

**Before (using workflow_engine):**
```python
from app.core.workflow_engine import workflow_engine

result = await workflow_engine.execute_workflow(
    workflow_id="123",
    user_id="user123",
    inputs={"input": "Hello"},
    stream=False
)
```

**After (using unified engine):**
```python
from app.core.engine_v2 import get_engine

# Get workflow data from database
workflow = await db.get_workflow(workflow_id, user_id)
flow_data = json.loads(workflow["flow_data"])

# Use unified engine
engine = get_engine()
engine.build(flow_data, user_context={"user_id": user_id, "workflow_id": workflow_id})
result = await engine.execute(inputs, user_context={"user_id": user_id})
```

### Clean-up checklist âœ… COMPLETED
```bash
# Files successfully deleted
âœ… backend/app/core/dynamic_chain_builder.py
âœ… backend/app/core/workflow_engine.py
âœ… backend/app/core/simple_runner.py (was already removed)
```

### Verification âœ… COMPLETED
* All API endpoints (`workflows.py`, `workflow_tasks.py`) migrated to unified engine
* Backward compatibility maintained through `WorkflowRunner` shim
* Basic functionality verified: validation âœ…, build âœ…, execution âœ…
* Legacy imports removed and replaced with `get_engine()` factory
